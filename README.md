# scheduleMakerSpring

## TODO
 - bug with having a shift that goes past 0 hour
 - have position warnings be attached to hour, day, days, week (strong man needed on monday morning to put away truck)
 - exceptional days, can deviate from schedule
 - system for feeding in sales data total for day or historical data in general, consider having something for that
